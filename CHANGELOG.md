## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-12

Initial release of PowDB — a from-scratch database engine with PowQL query language.

### Added

- **Storage engine**: slotted 4KB pages, heap files, B+ tree indexes (disk-persisted), WAL with group commit, buffer pool with clock-sweep eviction, mmap-based scanning
- **Row format**: compact binary encoding with 1-byte type tags, variable-length strings, support for Int, Float, Str, Bool, DateTime, UUID, Bytes types
- **Query language (PowQL)**: lexer, recursive-descent parser, pure-function planner, executor with compiled predicates
  - Schema: `type T { required field: type, ... }`
  - Insert: `insert T { field := value, ... }`
  - Query pipeline: `T filter .field > val order .field desc limit N { .f1, .f2 }`
  - Aggregates: `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, `max()` with GROUP BY / HAVING
  - Joins: INNER, LEFT OUTER, RIGHT OUTER (rewritten to LEFT), CROSS
  - Subqueries: IN, EXISTS, NOT IN, NOT EXISTS (correlated and uncorrelated)
  - Window functions: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX OVER
  - Set operations: UNION, UNION ALL
  - EXPLAIN for query plan inspection
  - CAST, CASE/WHEN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL/IS NOT NULL
  - Scalar functions: UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH, TRIM, SUBSTRING, CONCAT, ABS, ROUND, CEIL, FLOOR, SQRT, POW, NOW, EXTRACT, DATE_ADD, DATE_DIFF
  - UPSERT with ON CONFLICT
  - ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP COLUMN
  - Materialized views (CREATE VIEW, REFRESH VIEW, DROP VIEW)
- **Plan cache**: FNV-1a canonical hashing, literal substitution at lookup time
- **Executor fast paths**: compiled predicates for zero-decode filtering, fused scan+update, fused scan+delete, sort+limit, project+limit, aggregation fast paths
- **Plan lowering**: `RangeScan` → `Filter(SeqScan)` for unindexed columns at execution time
- **TCP server**: Tokio-based, binary wire protocol, password authentication, connection limits, graceful shutdown
- **CLI**: rustyline REPL with embedded and remote modes
- **TypeScript client**: `@zvndev/powdb-client` with full wire protocol support
- **Benchmarks**: criterion regression gate (20 workloads, per-workload thresholds), wide comparison suite vs SQLite/Postgres/MySQL
- **CI**: clippy + fmt + test workflow, criterion regression gate workflow
- **Performance**: 1.3x–10.8x faster than SQLite across all 15 comparison workloads at 100K rows

### Performance (100K rows, vs SQLite)

| Workload | Ratio |
|---|---|
| point_lookup_indexed | 3.8x faster |
| scan_filter_count | 6.7x faster |
| agg_min | 10.8x faster |
| agg_sum | 9.2x faster |
| update_by_filter | 3.2x faster |
| delete_by_filter | 1.3x faster |
